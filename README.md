# Students_Performance_EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project using a student performance dataset. The main objective of this project is to extract meaningful insights through visual and statistical exploration of data. The dataset includes various features such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental education level, and scores in math, reading, and writing

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Student Performance


## Overview

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to analyze the performance of students based on various features such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, and test preparation completion. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and relationships in the data, and provide actionable insights.

## Objectives

- Perform initial data inspection and cleaning
- Visualize numerical and categorical data distributions
- Identify correlations and relationships between features
- Generate insights from the data using statistical and visual techniques

## Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries
- **FPDF**: To generate PDF reports from the EDA observations

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Inspection**: Use `.info()` and `.describe()` to get an overview of the dataset, check for missing values, and inspect the types of data.
2. **Univariate Analysis**: Analyze the distribution of individual features using histograms, boxplots, and count plots.
3. **Bivariate Analysis**: Explore relationships between numerical features using scatterplots and between categorical and numerical features using boxplots or violin plots.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Use a heatmap to analyze correlations between numerical features.
5. **Observations**: Create a detailed report of findings from the visualizations and statistical analysis.
